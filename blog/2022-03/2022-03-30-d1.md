这些天，一直在学习数据结构和算法。软件开发的学习路程，是非常的漫长和艰难的。当看到国内各种各样的裁员新闻，自己还是有一些
庆幸，但是也一直督促自己坚持学习与进步。
除了技术，英语也是需要学习技能，但是苦于一直难以进步，今天想到一个办法，就是每天写一遍文章，并且把它翻译成英语。我想这样，至少可以坚持
下去。

These days, I have been learning about data structure and algorithm. The learning curve of software development is very long and difficult.
When I saw all the news about layoffs around the country, there are still some glad, but also urged myself to adhere to learning and progress.
